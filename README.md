# Minesweeper-Miinaharava
Minesweeper, in which you can choose grid and amount of mines per line.
I made this project in my first year at university. In my opinion this project was somewhat succesful, because I
got to learn more how to work with tkinter-GUI and how to initialize objects in projects more efficiently.
